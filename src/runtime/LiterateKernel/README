Eli version

- resolve FIXMEs

the runtiem (i.e., Builtin, Integer and Mk)

- add profiling etc left out of original version

- do something with blocks marked #if 0 or equiv

- standardise all the different schemes for debugging information output
(SHOW, EDB, DEBUG, debug etc), make sure all modules have suitable tracing
support
