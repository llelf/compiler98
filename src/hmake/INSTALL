The short version is:

  $ ./configure   [ --prefix=/my/installation ]
  $ make
  $ make install

which builds the hmake compilation-tool and places it in /usr/local,
[or in /my/installation if you used the --prefix= option].
If you want slightly more control, try

  $ make help

which will give you a list of other build targets.  During
configuration, we try to detect all your existing installed Haskell
compilers, tell hmake where they live, and choose one with which to
build hmake.  You can override the chosen build-compiler and many
other configuration settings from the commandline.

  $ configure  --help

gives a summary of all your configuration options.


Note: if you have a binary distribution of hmake, then you simply omit
the build step:

  $ ./configure   [ --prefix=/my/installation ]
  $ make install
