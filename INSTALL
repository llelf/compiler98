The short version is:

  $ ./configure   [ --prefix=/my/installation ]
  $ make
  $ make install

which provides you with the basic nhc98 compiler in /usr/local,
[or in /my/installation if you used the --prefix= option].
If you want slightly more control, try

  $ make help

which will give you a list of other build targets.  The default
target is 'basic' which gives you the basic system.  'make all'
gives you heap profiling and tracing in addition.
