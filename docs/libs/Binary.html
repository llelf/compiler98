<h3>Programming model</h3>
<p>
Both in-heap data compression and binary I/O can be achieved using the
York <tt>Binary</tt> library.  The basic model is rather like file
I/O:  binary data resides in a separate space which is accessed only
through a <tt>BinHandle</tt> acting like a buffering file descriptor.
Each item of binary data lies at a particular position within the
space, the position being denoted by a <tt>BinPtr</tt>.  Data can be
written and read sequentially just as with ordinary files.  Also, like
ordinary files, we allow random-access reading and writing.  However,
the particular beauty of this scheme is the ability to engage in
<em>pure, lazy,</em> random-access reading when a <tt>BinHandle</tt> is
in the appropriate <tt>RO</tt> (read-only) mode.  (A <tt>BinHandle</tt>
which is already open for writing can be changed to <tt>RO</tt> mode
with the <tt>freezeBin</tt> call.)

<p>
<tt>BinHandle</tt>s do not just denote files - they can also refer to
areas of heap memory.  One such area is available by default - called
<tt>stdmem</tt> - but new areas can be opened in just the
same way as files.  They are opened in the default mode <tt>RW</tt>.
Binary heap areas grow automatically to fit the data placed in them, and,
like files, they are naturally garbage-collected when they are no longer
in use.  (The <tt>closeBin</tt> operation is an explicit means to close
a file or discard some memory.)

<p>
There are in principle two layers to the library functions.  At the
lower level, functions like <tt>getBits</tt> and <tt>putBits</tt> deal
with raw bounded integers in the bit-stream.  At the higher level, a
type class abstracts these operations across arbitrary datatypes,
providing overloaded functions <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt>.


<h3>Low-level raw bit-stream functions</h3>
<p>
Each BinHandle has a notion of its ``current'' position.  This is the
position at which a subsequent read or write operation will start.  You
can think of it as a bit-offset from the start of the file/memory.  The
function <tt>putBits</tt> writes some bits into the bit-stream.  Its first
argument is the number of bits to write, and the second is an int value
representing those bits.  (Hence there is a maximum of 32 bits that can be
written or read in one operation.)  The function <tt>getBits</tt>
similarly reads a number of bits from the bit-stream, returning an int
which represents their value.  Both operations update the ``current''
position in the stream.
<pre>
    putBits    :: BinHandle -> Int -> Int -> IO (BinPtr a)
    getBits    :: BinHandle -> Int -> IO Int
    getBitsF   :: BinHandle -> Int -> BinPtr a -> (Int, BinPtr b)
</pre>

<p>
The pure lazy function <tt>getBitsF</tt> is slightly different - because
its result depends only on its arguments, you must tell it what position
to start reading from.  (It also returns the position immediately following
the value read as part of its result.)

<p>
In order to get full control of the bit-stream, there are various other
operations available, to move the current position, to report the current
position, and so on.
<pre>
    seekBin    :: BinHandle -> BinPtr a -> IO ()
    tellBin    :: BinHandle -> IO (BinPtr a)
    isEOFBin   :: BinHandle -> IO Bool
</pre>



<h3>Higher-level typed binary functions</h3>
<p>
The <tt>Binary</tt> class is derivable for any datatype defined in a
program except functions.  (Please note however that cyclic or infinite
values will cause the compressing function to diverge.)

<p>
The class member functions and their derivatives come in two varieties,
one for sequential
access, the other for random access.  A <tt>BinHandle</tt> contains a
hidden state, including the <em>current position</em> in the file or
memory.  Understanding the notion of the current position is important
for using the sequential operations correctly.  <tt>put</tt> and
<tt>get</tt> always start reading or writing from the current position.
All operations <em>including the random-access ones</em>, when they
return, set the current position to the end of the value which has
just been read or written.

<table><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>put :: BinHandle -> a -> IO (BinPtr a)</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>put bh x</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>writes a binary representation of the ordinary value
      <tt>x</tt> sequentially at the current position, returning a pointer
      to the beginning of the value.
      Where later sequential reading is sufficient, the return value of
      <tt>put</tt> can be discarded.  When random-access is required, the
      return value of <tt>put</tt> can be used as the positional argument of
      <tt>getAt</tt> and <tt>putAt</tt>.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>get :: BinHandle -> IO a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>get bh</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>reads a binary representation sequentially from the current
      position, returning the ordinary representation of the value.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>putAt :: BinHandle -> a -> BinPtr a -> IO ()</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>putAt bh p x</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>writes a binary representation of the ordinary value
      <tt>x</tt> at the position <tt>p</tt>, returning nothing.  The pointer
      <tt>p</tt> might have been obtained as the result of an earlier
      <tt>put</tt> operation, or it may been read from a binary stream via
      a <tt>get</tt> operation, or indeed it may have been calculated.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>getAt :: BinHandle -> BinPtr a -> IO a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>getAt bh p</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>reads a binary representation from the position <tt>p</tt>, 
      returning the ordinary representation of the value.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>getFAt :: BinHandle -> BinPtr a -> a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>getFAt bh p</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>is a pure, lazy, version of the <tt>getAt</tt> method, which
      can only be used on "frozen" <tt>BinHandle</tt>s.</td>

<h3>Transferring bits in bulk</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to transfer bits in bulk is with the <tt>copyBin</tt>
operation.  It takes an active <tt>BinHandle</tt> and copies its entire
contents into the given <tt>BinLocation</tt>, returning a fresh
<tt>BinHandle</tt> denoting the copy.  As an alternative,
<tt>copyBytes</tt> copies just a section of a bit-stream from the current
position in one <tt>BinHandle</tt> to the current position in another - the
copied section must be entirely byte-aligned.  Finally, the least efficient
but most flexible bulk transfer operation is <tt>copyBits</tt>, which allows
any number of bits to be copied without alignment constraints - it even
allows the source and destination bitstreams to overlap within the same
BinHandle.

<h3>Defining your own compression</h3>
<p>
If you want to play with defining your own instances of <tt>Binary</tt>, have
a look at some of the instances for standard types like Int and Lists
in <tt>src/prelude/Binary/Instances.hs</tt> to see how things work.

<p>
The lower-level tools used in defining instances are:
<pre>
    getBits  :: BinHandle -> Int -> BinPtr a -> IO Int
    putBits  :: BinHandle -> Int -> Int      -> IO (BinPtr a)
    getBitsF :: BinHandle -> Int -> BinPtr a -> (Int, BinPtr b)
    (<<) :: ((a->b),c) -> (c->(a,d)) -> (b,d)
</pre>



<hr>
<h3>Read and write modes</h3>
<p>
A file <tt>BinHandle</tt> can be opened in one of three modes: read-only
(<tt>RO</tt>), write-only (<tt>WO</tt>), or read-write (<tt>RW</tt>).
A memory <tt>BinHandle</tt> is always opened in <tt>RW</tt> mode, but
may be changed to <tt>RO</tt> mode by the <tt>freezeBin</tt> operation.
These modes differ from those of ordinary textual files:

<dl>
<dt>A binary operation never raises an I/O exception.</dt>
  <dd>When in <tt>RO</tt> mode, the operations <tt>put</tt> and <tt>putAt</tt>
      will not fail, but nor will they alter the file/memory.
  <dd>When in <tt>WO</tt> mode, the operations <tt>get</tt> and <tt>getAt</tt>
      will return odd values, not corresponding to the real file/memory.
  <dd>Encountering EOF in <tt>RO</tt> mode does not raise an error -
      reading beyond the end of the file/memory will simply return zeros.
      However, the operation <tt>isEOFBin</tt> can be used to test the
      condition.
  <dd>The <tt>getFAt</tt> operation <em>will</em> give a runtime error if
      the file/memory is not in <tt>RO</tt> mode, but since this error does
      not arise within the I/O monad. it cannot be trapped.
<dt>In <tt>RW</tt> mode, interleaving read and write operations is safe.</dt>
  <dd>The semantics of <tt>RW</tt> mode is that the file/memory is
      <em>overwritten</em>.  In other words, you can write just a single
      bit in the middle of the file/memory if you want to - everything else
      will stay the same.  In particular, unlike <tt>WO</tt> mode, a file is
      not truncated when you open it.
