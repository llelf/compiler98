  <h1>Configuring nhc98</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>
The automatic configuration and installation utility, called
<em>configure</em>, should always be used to prepare for building or
installing <b>nhc98</b>.  You can choose your own configuration options,
but the default behaviour is to prepare to build the components of
<b>nhc98</b> under the
<tt>targets</tt> directory, and to install those components under
<tt>/usr/local</tt>, in the subdirectories <tt>bin</tt> (for scripts),
<tt>lib/nhc98</tt> (for executables and libraries),
<tt>include/nhc98</tt> (for interface and include files), and
<tt>man/man1</tt> for man pages.

<p>
The endian-ness of your machine is detected automatically during
configuration.  Your machine/operating-system is detected and used
during building and installation to ensure that object files and
executables from different architectures do not interfere with each
other.  If you have any existing installations of Haskell compilers,
we search for those and configure <em>hmake</em> to use them.  We
also guess which compiler you will use to build <em>nhc98</em> -
in order of preference: <em>hbc</em>, then <em>ghc</em>, then an
older installation of <em>nhc98</em>.

<p>
<em>configure</em> has many options to override the default build and
installation behaviours.  The options fall into three categories, but
they may appear in any order on the command-line.  The first group of
options controls what task <em>nhc98config</em> will do.  You can only
choose one of these - if you choose more than one, only the final one
will take effect.  The other two groups of options are cached and
re-used in later invocations of <em>nhc98config</em>, but you can always
override them on the current commandline.

<dl>
<dt><b>-h</b></dt>
<dt><b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd>Give a brief explanation of all the options.  Do not save any
      configuration settings.</dd>

<dt><b>-v</b></dt>
<dt><b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd>Report package versions.  Do not save any configuration settings.</dd>

<dt><b>--config</b></dt>
  <dd>Set and report configuration options.  [This is the default behaviour
      if no other option from the first group is chosen.]</dd>

<dt><b>--install</b></dt>
  <dd>Install selected components now (scripts, executables, libraries,
      interface files, man pages, html documents etc.).  This option
      should not normally be used - use <tt>make install</tt> instead.
      However for information, it copies the selected components to their
      final directory locations (you must have permission to write into
      those directories).  Don't forget, if you have previously
      run <em>configure</em> with any options set, the previous
      settings will be cached and used for this install - but you can
      override them now on the commandline if you wish.</dd>

</dl>


<p>
The second and third group of options control the configuration process
and are entirely orthogonal to each other.  The second group configures
some general settings.

<dl>

<dt><b>-H</b><em>num</em></dt>
<dt><b>--heap=</b><em>num</em></dt>
  <dd>Set the default heapsize for programs compiled by <b>nhc98</b>.
      (Users can still control heapsize from the commandline, this option
      just configures the default.)  <em>num</em> may be expressed as a
      simple integer, or with suffixes <em>K</em> or <em>M</em>, and may be
      followed by units <em>B</em> (bytes) or <em>W</em> (words).  Suffixes
      are case-insensitive, e.g. <tt>-H4mb</tt>.  The default setting is for
      400Kb of heap.  You can use this option even when installing from
      a binary package.</dd>

<dt><b>--builddir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given base directory for intermediate object files instead of
      the default <tt>./targets</tt>.</dd>

<dt><b>--installdir=</b><em>rootdir</em></dt>
<dt><b>--prefix=</b><em>rootdir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory as the installation root instead of the
      default <tt>/usr/local</tt>.</dd>

<dt><b>--bindir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory for installing scripts instead of the
      default directory, <tt>bin</tt> under the installation
      root.</dd>

<dt><b>--libdir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory for installing executables and libraries
      instead of the default directory, <tt>lib/nhc98</tt> under the
      installation root.</dd>

<dt><b>--incdir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory for installing interface and include files
      instead of the default directory, <tt>include/nhc98</tt> under the
      installation root.</dd>

<dt><b>--mandir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory for installing manual pages
      instead of the default directory, <tt>man/man1</tt> under the
      installation root.</dd>

<dt><b>--docdir=</b><em>dir</em></dt>
  <dd>Use the given directory for installing the html documentation
      instead of the default directory, <tt>/usr/doc/nhc98</tt>.</dd>

</dl>


<p>
Finally, the third group of options allows you to select which
components of the package you wish to install.  They can be useful when
installing the same software for many architectures on a heterogeneous
network, if you don't want to continually re-install shared components
such as man pages.  As another example, you may want to update just the
scripts from a new beta release, without re-installing the executables.

<dl>
<dt><b>[+/-]lib</b></dt>
  <dd>Do (or don't) install the executables and library files (default is +).</dd>
<dt><b>[+/-]inc</b></dt>
  <dd>Do (or don't) install the include and interface files (default is +).</dd>
<dt><b>[+/-]bin</b></dt>
  <dd>Do (or don't) install the scripts (default is +).</dd>
<dt><b>[+/-]man</b></dt>
  <dd>Do (or don't) install the man pages (default is +).</dd>
<dt><b>[+/-]docs</b></dt>
  <dd>Do (or don't) install the html documents (default is -).</dd>
</dl>
