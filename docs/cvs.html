<p>
This page tells you how to get CVS access to the latest, most current,
<em>nhc98</em> sources.

<h3>Remote Read-only CVS Access</h3>

<p>
Read-only access is available to anyone - there's no need to ask us
first. To get read-only access to our repository:

<ul>
<li> You need to have <em>ssh</em> (secure shell) installed
<li> Set your CVS_RSH environment variable to <tt>ssh</tt>
<li> The first time you access the repository, you'll need to do
     the following:
<pre>
        $ cvs -d :ext:anoncvs@hinken.sparud.net:/cvs checkout nhc
</pre>
     The checked-out source tree for <em>nhc98</em> will appear in a
     directory called <tt>nhc</tt>.  You can rename this directory to
     whatever you like, CVS won't mind.
<li> From then on, you should no longer need the <em>-d</em> option,
     and commands like
<pre>
        $ cvs diff
        $ cvs update
</pre>
     should work, provided your working directory is somewhere inside
     the checked out tree.  In normal use, <tt>cvs update</tt>
     is the command to merge the latest changes from the central
     repository into your local tree.  <tt>cvs diff</tt> gives you
     the differences between your version and the central version.
<li> If you change your current directory into a sub-directory of the
     CVS tree, cvs commands will normally operate only on that subtree,
     not on the full tree.  This is very handy if you are only interested
     in a small part of the source.
</ul>

<p>
With read-only CVS access you can do anything except commit changes
to the repository. You can make changes to your local tree, and still
use CVS's update facility to keep your tree otherwise up-to-date,
and you can generate patches using <tt>cvs diff</tt> in order to send
to us for inclusion.

<p>
To set up default flags for some of the CVS commands, you can create
a <tt>.cvsrc</tt> file.  For instance, the -P flag to 'checkout'
says prune empty directories, which is normally what you want.
Here is an example <tt>.cvsrc</tt> file:
<pre>
        checkout -P
        release -d
        update -P
        diff -c
</pre>
