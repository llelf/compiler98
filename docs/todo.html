<hr>

<p>
Our plans for <b>nhc98</b> include the following.

<ul>
<li>The <em>Fudgets</em> GUI library was once available for nhc13:
    now that nhc98 has existential types, we can now support Fudgets
    once again.
<li>The implementation of <em>GreenCard</em> should be finished.
    Remaining unimplemented features include named field syntax
    and failure specifications.
<li>It would be very useful to have a set of simple regression tests
    (with an automated interface) to check whether anything breaks on
    a new machine architecture, or after modifying a part of the compiler.
    (We have a set of tests for the binary libraries, and they have
    definitely proved their worth!)
<li>As part of the cross-compilation idea, it might be important to
    be able to pass the word-size of the target machine into the compiler
    at compile-time.  (It is currently hard-coded in.)
<li>We would like to replace the current textual format of interface files
    with a binary format.  (We conjecture a big speed gain during compilation.)
    One difficulty is that nhc98 is often built with hbc, which
    does not yet support Binary.  However, it would be of even greater
    interest to obtain a speed gain when using an nhc98 built with nhc98!
<li>We hope to continue to improve the tracer, supporting some of the more
    tricky language features, and eventually adding a meta-tracer for
    defining and using trace <em>strategies</em>.
</ul>
