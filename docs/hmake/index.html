<h1>hmake - a make tool for Haskell programs</h1>
</center>

<hr>

<h3>What is hmake?</h3>
<p>
<em>hmake</em> is a compilation manager for Haskell programs.
See <a href="hmake.html">hmake.html</a> for more details.

<h3>What is hmake interactive?</h3>
<p>
<em>hmake interactive</em>, or <em>hi</em> for short, is an interactive
program development environment for Haskell, rather like <em>Hugs</em>.
See <a href="interactive.html">interactive.html</a> for more details.

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>
Download the hmake (including <em>hi</em>) sources from
  <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/haskell/hmake/">
  <tt>ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/haskell/hmake/</tt></a><br>

<p>
(Note: If you have the nhc98 compiler, then you already have
hmake.  The standard configuration and build process for the compiler
should have done everything for you.  However, if you installed ghc,
hbc, etc, after nhc98, you will probably need to update the config file
for hmake.  See <a href="hmake-config.html">hmake-config.html</a>.)

<h3>Configure, compile, and install</h3>
<p>
<pre>
  $ ./configure  --prefix=/my/installation
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

<h3>Configuration options</h3>
<p>
Use
<pre>
  $ configure --help
</pre>
to discover what options you can change at configuration time.  The
configuration process actually does quite a good job of detecting what
Haskell compilers you have, where they live, and anything special they
might need.  However, should you need to change anything later by hand,
use the <a href="hmake-config.html"><em>hmake-config</em></a> utility.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
`harch' is a little script for determining your processor/OS
combination.  It is supplied because many sites have heterogeneous
networks of machines all accessing a common filespace.  You only need to
install one copy of the `hmake' script, which uses `harch' to select the
correct executables for any particular machine.

<p>
The system-wide hmakerc configuration file lives in:
<pre>
    /usr/local/lib/hmake/$MACHINE/hmakerc
</pre>
(Of course, you don't have to use the root location /usr/local for
your installation.  Just use --prefix= at configuration time to
reflect your preference.)

<p>
A personal hmakerc configuration file can live in:
<pre>
    $HOME/.hmakerc/$MACHINE
</pre>
Normally, a user will simply use the system-wide hmakerc.  If they
use <em>hmake-config</em> to make any customisations, a personal
hmakerc file will be created for them.  (Only the person who installs
hmake can change the system-wide hmakerc).
