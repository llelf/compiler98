<h1>hmake - a make tool for Haskell programs</h1>
</center>

<hr>

<h3>What is hmake?</h3>
<p>
<em>hmake</em> is a compilation manager for Haskell programs.
See <a href="hmake.html">hmake.html</a> for more details.

<h3>What is hmake interactive?</h3>
<p>
<em>hmake interactive</em>, or <em>hi</em> for short, is an interactive
program development environment for Haskell, rather like <em>Hugs</em>.
See <a href="interactive.html">interactive.html</a> for more details.

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>
Download the hmake (including <em>hi</em>) sources from
  <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/haskell/hmake/">
  <tt>ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/haskell/hmake/</tt></a>

<p>
(Note: If you have the nhc98 compiler, then you already have
hmake.  The standard configuration and build process for the compiler
should have done everything for you.  However, if you installed ghc,
hbc, etc, after nhc98, you will probably need to update the config file
for hmake.  See below.)

<h3>Configure, compile, and install</h3>
<p>
<pre>
  $ ./configure  --prefix=/my/installation
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

<h3>Configuration options</h3>
<p>
Use
<pre>
  $ configure --help
</pre>
to discover what options you can change at configuration time.  The
configuration process actually does quite a good job of detecting what
Haskell compilers you have, where they live, and anything special they
might need.  However, should you need to change anything by hand,
see the notes below about the <em>hmake.config</em> file.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
`harch' is a little script for determining your processor/OS
combination.  It is supplied because many sites have heterogeneous
networks of machines all accessing a common filespace.  You only need to
install one copy of the `hmake' script, which uses `harch' to select the
correct executables for any particular machine.

<p>
The hmake.config file can appear in any of several places:
<pre>
    $HOME/.hmakerc
    /usr/local/lib/hmake/$MACHINE/hmake.config
    /usr/local/lib/hmake/hmake.config
</pre>
These are searched for in order - the first found overrides the others.
Hence, individual users can add their own Haskell systems, and
particular machine architectures can offer variations from the standard
system-wide config.

<p>
Of course, you don't have to use the locations /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/lib for your installation.  Just use --prefix= at configuration
time to reflect your preference.
