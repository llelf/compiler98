<tr>

<td valign=top><b>2.02</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> Note: <font color=red>patch-2.02-devnull</font> must be
             applied to fix the unfortunate behaviour that the
             configure script destroys <tt>/dev/null</tt> if you
             run it as root.
        <li> Improved the error-reporting in <em>hmake</em>.  When
		a module cannot be found, it now shows where the
		demand for the module arose, and which directories
		were searched.
        <li> Added knowledge of extended file suffixes like <em>.p.o</em>,
		<em>.T.o</em>, and <em>.T.hi</em> to <em>hmake</em>.
        <li> Fixed a bug in the generation of Makefile dependencies in
		the presence of a <em>-I</em> option.
        <li> Ghc's options <tt>-syslib n</tt> and <tt>-package n</tt> no
		longer need to be enclosed in double quotes.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>2.01</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> If you build <em>hi</em> with ghc, the automatic
             configuration now detects and links in the <em>readline</em>
             library for command-line editing.  (Thanks to Simon Marlow
             for the code changes.)
        <li> <em>hi</em> now uses unique temporary filenames so that
             multiple users on one machine do not conflict with each other.
             (Thanks to Kamo Hiroyasu for the suggestion.)  Temporaries
             are also now tidied up afterwards.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>2.00</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> Many improvements to <em>hi</em>, which moves out of
             alpha-testing to beta.  We think this is worth an
             increment to the major version number.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.9</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> New options: -clean and -realclean, which remove relevant
               .o files (or both .o and .hi files).
        <li> Addition of a simple line editor to <em>hi</em>.
        <li> Bugfix: the auto-configuration of <em>hi</em> was erratic,
               but should now work much more smoothly.
        <li> Bugfix: all the nasty possibilities of unmatched comment
	       characters inside strings and unmatched quote chars
	       inside comments no longer cause hmake to give up on
	       trying to extract dependencies from a file.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.8</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> New addition: hmake interactive, or <em>hi</em> for short.
               Looks and feels like Hugs, but uses hmake + any Haskell
               compiler as a backend.
	<li> Small bugfixes, for instance to allow #-} at the beginning
               of a line (previously interpreted as a cpp directive!).
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small configure script patch for BUILDWITH variable.
	<li> Small driver script patch to permit -N option again.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small configuration patch for hmake built from C sources.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> The previous patch for detecting hbc 0.9999.5 was wrong, now fixed.
	<li> However, you cannot build hmake with hbc 0.9999.5 (at least on
	     linux-libc6), as that compiler has buggy libraries.  A binary
	     distribution built with ghc is available for this platform as
	     an alternative.
	<li> It often makes sense to have the default compiler called by
	     hmake to be the same as the one that built it.  This is now
	     enabled by default.  You can override it by editing the COMP
             variable in your hmake.config file, or by setting your HC
             environment variable at runtime.
	<li> Treatment of the <b>-i</b><em>dir</em> option has been changed:
	     it is now identical to the <b>-I</b><em>dir</em> option, for
	     compatibility with hbc and ghc.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small patch for detecting hbc version >= 0.9999.5 correctly.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small cosmetic patch to fix the -g flag (module dependency
             graph) whose output had multiple entries for some imports
             (depending on how many blank lines preceded it).
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Import determination is no longer confused by {- -} nested
             comments, end-of-line comments, or line-breaks between the
             "import"/"qualified" keywords and module name.
	<li> <em>hmake</em> driver script now returns true exit status.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.5</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Configuration now automatically determines which Haskell
             compilers are available, where they live, and so on - no
             editing of files required.
	<li> Some minor bugfixes.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.4</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Symbol error in GetDep.hs when compiling with ghc, fixed.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.3</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Cpp-emulation now understands numeric comparisons.
	<li> Compiler cpp symbols (e.g. <tt>__HBC__</tt>) are not defined twice now.
	<li> Revert to allowing <em>both</em> GHCINCDIR and GHCINCPATH.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Allow "<tt>import A-- comment</tt>", "<tt>import A;</tt>",
             "<tt>import A{-comment-}</tt>".
	<li> Change GHCINCDIR to GHCINCPATH to allow multiple directories
             for prelude .hi files.
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>	Minor bug fixes.
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.0</b></td>
  <td valign=top>	Initial release (separated from nhc98/nhc13).
