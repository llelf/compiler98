<tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.8</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
        <li> New addition: hmake interactive, or <em>hi</em> for short.
             Looks and feels like
             Hugs, but uses hmake + any Haskell compiler as a backend.
	<li> Small bugfixes, for instance to allow #-} at the beginning
             of a line (previously interpreted as a cpp directive!).
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small configure script patch for BUILDWITH variable.
	<li> Small driver script patch to permit -N option again.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small configuration patch for hmake built from C sources.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.7</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> The previous patch for detecting hbc 0.9999.5 was wrong, now fixed.
	<li> However, you cannot build hmake with hbc 0.9999.5 (at least on
	     linux-libc6), as that compiler has buggy libraries.  A binary
	     distribution built with ghc is available for this platform as
	     an alternative.
	<li> It often makes sense to have the default compiler called by
	     hmake to be the same as the one that built it.  This is now
	     enabled by default.  You can override it by editing the COMP
             variable in your hmake.config file, or by setting your HC
             environment variable at runtime.
	<li> Treatment of the <b>-i</b><em>dir</em> option has been changed:
	     it is now identical to the <b>-I</b><em>dir</em> option, for
	     compatibility with hbc and ghc.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small patch for detecting hbc version >= 0.9999.5 correctly.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Small cosmetic patch to fix the -g flag (module dependency
             graph) whose output had multiple entries for some imports
             (depending on how many blank lines preceded it).
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.6</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Import determination is no longer confused by {- -} nested
             comments, end-of-line comments, or line-breaks between the
             "import"/"qualified" keywords and module name.
	<li> <em>hmake</em> driver script now returns true exit status.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.5</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Configuration now automatically determines which Haskell
             compilers are available, where they live, and so on - no
             editing of files required.
	<li> Some minor bugfixes.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.4</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Symbol error in GetDep.hs when compiling with ghc, fixed.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.3</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Cpp-emulation now understands numeric comparisons.
	<li> Compiler cpp symbols (e.g. <tt>__HBC__</tt>) are not defined twice now.
	<li> Revert to allowing <em>both</em> GHCINCDIR and GHCINCPATH.
	</ul>
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.2</b></td>
  <td valign=top>
	<ul>
	<li> Allow "<tt>import A-- comment</tt>", "<tt>import A;</tt>",
             "<tt>import A{-comment-}</tt>".
	<li> Change GHCINCDIR to GHCINCPATH to allow multiple directories
             for prelude .hi files.
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.1</b></td>
  <td valign=top>	Minor bug fixes.
</td></tr><tr>

<td valign=top><b>1.0</b></td>
  <td valign=top>	Initial release (separated from nhc98/nhc13).
