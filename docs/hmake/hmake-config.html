<center><h1>The <em>hmake-config</em> utility</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>
<em>Hmake-config</em> is a small utility for managing your hmake
configuration.  It updates an <em>hmakerc</em> file by adding or
deleting knowledge about a particular Haskell compiler, or changing
the default compiler.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The basic option summary is:
<pre>
    Usage: hmake-config [cfgfile] [add|delete|default] compiler
</pre>
The specification of a <em>cfgfile</em> is optional - if it is
not given, the file <tt>$HOME/.hmakerc/$MACHINE</tt> is assumed.
(If you use a non-standard location for the hmakerc file, you will
also need to tell <em>hmake</em> where it is on every invocation.)
If the config file does not yet exist, it is created by copying
the system-wide configuration from your machine's installation of
<em>hmake</em>.  (Usually in <tt>/usr/local/lib/$MACHINE/hmakerc</tt>,
where <tt>$MACHINE</tt> is the machine architecture as reported by
<tt>`harch`</tt>, not the actual machine name.)

<p>
One of the actions <em>add</em>, <em>delete</em>, or <em>default</em>
is applied to the <em>compiler</em> given on the commandline.  (If no
action is given, <em>add</em> is assumed.)  The <em>compiler</em>
can be specified either as a simple name which resolves to an
executable command name via the normal <tt>$PATH</tt> mechanism, or as an
absolute pathname to the compiler.

<center>
<table border=1 width=400><tr>
<td><b>add</b><br></td>
	<td>The specified compiler is probed for various pieces of
            information, including its version, and the paths to
            directories holding interface files for standard libraries.
            If everything is OK, that compiler's configuration is added
            to the hmakerc file, or if it was already known, the
            configuration is updated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>delete</b></td>
	<td>All configuration information for the specified compiler is
            removed from the hmakerc file.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>default</b></td>
	<td>Provided the specified compiler is already known in the
            hmakerc file, it is made the default compiler.  If it is not
            known, the default remains unchanged and an error is reported.
            </td>
</tr></table>
</center>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The hmakerc file manipulated by <em>hmake-config</em> is written in
plain text, as a structured Haskell value.  You are free to read it,
and edit it by hand if you wish.  Be aware however that a later use
of <em>hmake-config</em> with the action <em>add</em> may override
any changes you make.

<p>
To support users who may have access to heterogeneous machines on a
network with a shared filespace, there is a separate <em>hmakerc</em>
file for each machine architecture they use.  This is very important
to avoid conflicts between versions of compilers.

<p>
It is difficult to detect the exact directories in which
<em>hbc</em> expects to find interface files for standard libraries.
Thus <em>hmake-config</em> relies on the environment variables
<tt>HBCDIR</tt> or <tt>LMLDIR</tt> for the correct location.

<p>
I'd welcome any bug reports, or ideas for other options or behaviours
you would find useful.
