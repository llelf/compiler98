<hr>
<p>
<em>Hmake interactive</em> allows you to type expressions at the
commandline, one expression per line.  If you have a long expression,
you are likely to make a mistake somewhere.  Hence, we include a
simple line editor to allow you to correct mistakes before pressing
the <tt>return</tt> key.

<p>
This line editor does <b>not</b> provide the full functionality you
would expect from, say, the <em>readline</em> library that is often
linked into <em>Hugs</em>.  In particular, there is not yet any
history mechanism for retrieving earlier expressions or commands.
It just provides a few very basic facilities - and of course, it is
written fully in Haskell'98.  Hence, do feel free to change or add
your own preferred keystrokes for editing.



<h3>Editing Keystrokes</h3>
<p>
A word of warning: the keystrokes noted in this table seem to be
extremely dependent on the terminal settings of the environment in
which you run <em>hi</em>.  You might need to experiment a little
to discover what works on your machine.  For my shell, I need to
set <tt>stty -icanon min 1</tt> for these to work.
