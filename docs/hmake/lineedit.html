<center><h1>The <em>hmake interactive</em> line editor</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>
<em>Hmake interactive</em> allows you to type expressions at the
commandline, one expression per line.  If you have a long expression,
you are likely to make a mistake somewhere.  Hence, we include a
simple line editor to allow you to correct mistakes before pressing
the <tt>return</tt> key.

<p>
Provided you have <em>readline</em> available on your system, and you
build <em>hi</em> with <em>ghc</em>, you will get all the readline
functionality built in to <em>hi</em> automatically.

<p>
However, if you don't have <em>readline</em>, or you didn't build with
<em>ghc</em>, you get a very basic line editor instead.  This line
editor does <b>not</b> provide the full functionality you would expect
from the <em>readline</em> library, but is provided on the grounds that
some basic editing is better than none at all.  In particular, there
is not yet any history mechanism for retrieving earlier expressions
or commands.  It just provides a few very basic facilities - and of
course, it is written fully in Haskell'98.  Hence, do feel free to
change or add your own preferred keystrokes for editing.



<h3>Editing Keystrokes</h3>
<p>
A word of warning: the keystrokes noted in this table seem to be
extremely dependent on the terminal settings of the environment in
which you run <em>hi</em>.  You might need to experiment a little
to discover what works on your machine.  For my shell, I need to
set <tt>stty -icanon min 1</tt> for these to work.
