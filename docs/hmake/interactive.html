<em>Hmake interactive!</em> is an interpreter-like environment that
you can wrap over any common Haskell compiler to achieve an interactive
development style.

<p>
It deliberately looks and feels a lot like Mark Jones' Hugs
interpreter.  The difference is that you get real compiled code,
compiled by your favorite compiler - you can even change compiler
on the fly, to check your code's portability!

<p>
Of course, one of the reasons people prefer Hugs over a compiler is
that Hugs generates runnable code very quickly compared to, say, ghc.
But all compilers are not equal - for instance, nhc98 is pretty
fast at generating code.  On a newish 500Mhz Pentium, <em>hmake
interactive!</em> compiles an expression typed at the commandline in
about one second with nhc98.  And if you compare compile time with
running time, nhc98's compiled code runs between 2-5 times faster
than Hugs, so you can easily end up with a net gain.

<p>
An even bigger potential advantage of <em>hmake interactive!</em>
is that it uses a smart recompilation strategy.  Big programs are
the ones on which you would most like to use a compiler, for the
benefit of speedy code.  However, in big projects, compile times
are long, so you really only want to recompile the modules you have
edited and those which depend on them.  Writing Makefiles is tedious
and error-prone, so Hugs is a reasonable alternative.  But because
<em>hmake interactive!</em> is just an interface to the standard
<em>hmake</em>, you get the benefit of its recompilation analysis
to rebuild only what is necessary, so you can reduce compile-times
significantly, whilst still achieving full compiled-code speed,
and what's more, you also have the Hugs-like ability to test small
expressions at the command-line.
