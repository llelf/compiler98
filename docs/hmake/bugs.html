<h1>Known bugs in <em>hmake</em></h1>
</center>
<hr>

<ul>
<li> If several <em>import</em> statements occur on the same line of
     a source file (separated by semicolons), then hmake will only
     recognise the first import on the line as a dependency.

<li> A Happy grammar (.y or .ly file) with a non-terminal
     name <em>import</em> confuses hmake, which reports that
     a <em>module ::</em> cannot be found.

<li> Conflicting compiler options (e.g. both -fsomething and
     -fno-something for ghc) may (rarely) be re-ordered by hmake,
     such that the compiler treats the conflict in the opposite way to
     your intention.  The exact circumstances in which any re-ordering
     happens are not currently pinned down.

</ul>
