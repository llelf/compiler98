<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>
In order to use <b>nhc98</b> under Windows 95/98 or NT, you first need to
install the Cygnus <em>gcc</em> C compiler and tools.  Essentially, it
should be as simple as downloading <em>gnu-win32/cdk.exe</em> from your
favorite Gnu-mirroring FTP site, and running it (it is a self-extracting
archive).  We tested with release <em>b19</em>.  (In Northern Europe, a
good mirror of the Gnu tools is
<a href="ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/gnu/cygnus/gnu-win32/">
SunSite</a>.)

<p>
With <em>gcc</em>, you also get the <em>bash</em> shell and lots of other
Unix tools, such as <em>tar</em>, <em>gunzip</em>, and <em>make</em>, which
are needed to unpack and build the <b>nhc98</b> distribution.
For full information on the Gnu Cygnus toolset, see
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">

<br><br>
<h3>And now...</h3>
<p>
Once you have installed <em>gcc</em> and tools, the standard
<a href="install.html">installation instructions</a> apply.
You have the option of installing the binary, C, or Haskell
distribution package.
