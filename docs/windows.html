<center><h1>Installing nhc98 under Windows</h1></center>

<hr>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>
In order to use <b>nhc98</b> under Windows 95/98/ME or NT/2000/XP, you first
need to install the Cygwin DLL, the <em>gcc</em> C compiler, and GNU tools.

<p>
For old Cygwin versions (<em>b19</em>, <em>b20</em>, and <em>b20.1</em>),
this involved downloading <em>cygwin/full.exe</em>
from your favorite Gnu-mirroring FTP site, and running it as a
self-extracting archive.  The newer Cygwin release version <em>1.0</em>
was available on CD-ROM only.  The very newest releases <em>1.1.x</em>
are once again available for download.  From <em>1.1.0</em> onwards, you
should download the small utility called <em>setup.exe</em> from a
Cygwin mirror FTP site and follow its instructions to install the
rest of the toolset.

<p>
Along with <em>gcc</em>, you should also get the <em>bash</em> shell
and lots of other Unix tools, such as <em>tar</em>, <em>gunzip</em>,
and <em>make</em>, which are needed to unpack and build the
<b>nhc98</b> distribution.  (It is safest to simply collect the
entire set of packages.)

<p>
Caution: some people report that their anti-virus software interacts
badly with Cygwin, slowing the entire Windows system to a crawl.
If you are surprised by the slowness of your system, try disabling
(or changing the settings in) your anti-virus package.

<p>
We last tested with Cygwin release <em>1.1.4</em>, together with
<em>gcc 2.95.2-4</em> and <em>make 3.79.1</em>.

<p>

<p>
In Northern Europe, a good mirror of the Cygwin toolset is

SunSite</a>.)


<p>
Some people have reported difficulty getting recent releases of nhc98
to build with older versions of Cygwin.  The make fails very quickly,
saying that there is "no rule to make target .../src/runtime/Kernel".
This could be due to one of several causes.
<ul>
<li> Ensure that the environment variable MAKE_MODE is set to UNIX.
<li> Gnu-make's $(patsubst ...) can't handle spaces in directory pathnames
     - so please ensure you don't have any!
<li> Untarring the source package sometimes mistakenly creates
     directory names in upper-case instead of lower-case.  (Ensure you
     untar in Windows itself, rather than onto a Windows partition
     from Linux, for example.)
<li> Some distributions of Gnu-make do not handle globbing in static
     pattern rules as they should.  (make 3.75 in Cygwin b20 is broken,
     although the same version works correctly on other platforms.)
     Upgrade (or downgrade) to a different (working) version of make.
</ul>



<br><br>
<h3>And now...</h3>
<p>
Once you have installed <em>gcc</em> and tools, the standard <a
href="install.html">installation instructions</a> apply.  You have
the option of installing the binary or source distribution packages.
(A prior installation of Cygwin is required even for the binary
distribution.)
