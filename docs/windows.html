<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>
In order to use <b>nhc98</b> under Windows 95/98 or NT, you first need to
install the Cygnus <em>gcc</em> C compiler and tools.  Essentially, it
should be as simple as downloading <em>cygwin/full.exe</em> from your
favorite Gnu-mirroring FTP site, and running it (it is a self-extracting
archive).  We last tested with release <em>b19</em>, but others have
reported success with <em>b20.1</em>.  (In Northern Europe, a
good mirror of the Gnu tools is
<a href="ftp://sunsite.org.uk/Mirrors/sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/cygwin-b20/">
SunSite</a>.)

<p>
Along with <em>gcc</em>, you also get the <em>bash</em> shell and lots
of other Unix tools, such as <em>tar</em>, <em>gunzip</em>, and
<em>make</em>, which are needed to unpack and build the <b>nhc98</b>
distribution.  For full information on the Gnu Cygnus toolset, see
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">

<br><br>
<h3>And now...</h3>
<p>
Once you have installed <em>gcc</em> and tools, the standard
<a href="install.html">installation instructions</a> apply.
You have the option of installing the binary, C, or Haskell
distribution package.
