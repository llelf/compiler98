<center><h1>GreenCard for nhc98</h1></center>

<hr>

<p>
<em>GreenCard</em> is a preprocessor for Haskell which allows Haskell
functions to call C.  A paper (now superseded, see below) published in
the Haskell Workshop 97 proceedings describes the design goals, input
language, and translation mechanism.  <em>GreenCard</em> is standard
across (almost) all implementations of Haskell.

<p>
Since the Haskell Workshop paper, several improvements have been made
to the input language and DIS macros.  <em>GreenCard</em> for <b>nhc98</b>
follows the design agreed with the Glasgow and Hugs implementors (although
the Glasgow implementation does not!).  Here is the best extant
<a href="greencard.html">description</a> closely matching
the <b>nhc98</b> version.

<p>
There are just a few differences specific to the <b>nhc98</b> version
of the tool.

<dl>
<dt>Some features are not yet implemented.</dt>
<dd><tt>%fail</tt> is currently ignored
    silently; <tt>%const</tt> generates a warning and terminates processing;
    you cannot yet use named fields (sometimes known as records) in DIS
    definitions.</dd>

<dt>Import clause needed.</dt>
<dd>The code generated by <em>GreenCard</em> uses certain library
    functions, which may not be visible in the source submitted to
    <em>GreenCard</em>.  To make things easier, we have collected these
    functions together into a single library module, which should always
    be imported when you use <em>GreenCard</em>.  Simply add the line
    <pre>
        import GreenCard
    </pre>
    to your source file.  <em>GreenCard</em> cannot add this line for
    you automatically.</dd>

<dt>Filename conventions.</dt>
<dd>Source files containing GreenCard directives should have a
    <tt>.gc</tt> extension.  Both <tt>nhc98</tt> and <tt>hmake</tt>
    recognise the <tt>.gc</tt> extension and call <em>GreenCard</em>
    automatically.  When <em>GreenCard</em> is run on a file
    <tt>Module.gc</tt> it generates two new files <tt>Module_.hs</tt>
    and <tt>Module_.c</tt> which are processed separately by
    <tt>nhc98</tt> proper and <tt>gcc</tt>.  The end result however is
    still a single object file called <tt>Module.o</tt>.  (We thought it
    would be useful to expose the generated files to the user, since
    any compilation errors will refer to these rather than to the
    original source (although of course the error must be fixed in the
    original <tt>.gc</tt> file)).</dd>

<dt>Calling Haskell from C.</dt>
<dd>The Haskell Workshop paper said that "in practice there is zero demand"
    for calling Haskell from C.  We disagree.  Using "stable pointers"
    however, it is possible to go some distance towards providing such a
    facility.  See the document
    <a href="CcallingHaskell.html">CcallingHaskell</a>  and
    file <tt>$NHC98DIR/lib/greencard.h</tt> for details.</dd>

<dt>DIS variable scope.</dt>
<dd>The original paper said: "All the C variables bound in the
    %call statement, and all those bound in declarations at the start of
    the body scope over all the result-marshalling statements (%result and
    %fail)".  However, it did not say anything about the scope of
    variables bound by a %result statement.  We say that variables bound
    in a %result statement are always declared implicitly and scope over
    the whole body.  For example, from the paper:
    <pre>
        %fun foo :: (Age,Age) -> Age
        %call (Age (int x), Age (int y))
        %code r = foo(x,y);
        %result (Age (int r))
    </pre>
    This example is correct, and indicates that the three variables x y and r
    are all declared as "int"s prior to the %code body, and scope over the
    body.
    <pre>
        %fun f :: This -> This
        %call (MkThis (int p) (float q, float r))
        %code int a,b,c;
        %     f( p, q, r, &a, &b, &c);
        %result (this a b c)
    </pre>
    But this example is incorrect, because the user's definitions of a b and c
    conflict with the automatic definition from the %result statement.  (The
    variables b and c are "float"s, but the user has tried to declare them as
    "int"s.</dd>
