<hr>

<p>
The latest stable release is 1.08.  The CVS development tree is now
at version 1.09.  Bugfixes and important changes to the system are
described here for the two most recent released versions.

<p>

<h3>nhc98 1.08 (2001-09-25) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Tunnels from hat-observe to hat-detect and hat-trail,
		enabling the user to jump directly to something of interest.
<li> New:	Prototype version of the portable source-to-source
		transformation is in progress.
<li> New:	More updates of the the Prelude/Libraries to match the
		recent revisions of the Haskell'98 Report.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous small bugfixes in hat-observe, hat-detect, and
		hat-trail.
<li> Bugfix:	You can now have multiple copies of hat-trail running
		simultaneously.
<li> Bugfix:	A module with an explicit null export list previously
		exported everything - now it correctly exports nothing.
<li> Bugfix:	In multiple equations with identical (n+k) patterns, only
		the first equation was ever matched, the rest were
		previously ignored.
<li> Bugfix:	A negative literal integer in a pattern caused a compiler
		error if the (-) function was not also used in an expression.
<li> Bugfix:	An imported named field, used both as a pattern and a
		selector in the same equation, gave rise to an
		"Unbound Identifier" error.
<li> Bugfix:	Fixes random crashes in primitive implementation of putStr.
<li> Bugfix:	Link options for ncurses (in src/tracer/hat) were in the
		wrong order.
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.06 (2001-06-08) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Updated the Prelude/Libraries to match the newly revised
		Haskell'98 Report.
<li> Update:	Default build target is now basic + tracer (was just basic).
<li> Update:	Building with gcc now builds everything with gcc, including
		profiling and tracing.  This is much faster.
<li> Bugfix:	A bad interaction between Java and Cygwin to do with Unix
		vs. Windows pathnames.  (Visible only in Hat-trail and Hood.)
<li> Bugfix:	An 'hi' built with just a C compiler seg-faulted, due to
                mismatched .c file versions in the 1.04 source package.
<li> Bugfix:	Recognise an existing ghc-5 installation.
<li> Bugfix:	Missing include <errno.h> for Cygwin.
<li> Bugfix:	Minor filename recognition error in hat-stack and hat-connect.
<li> Bugfix:	Filename extension for time profiling changed to .z.o to
		avoid Windows conflicts between .T.o and .t.o.  The compiler
		flags -T and -t are unchanged, -z is a new synonym for -t.
</ul>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic, stable, components include the compiler itself, the Standard
Prelude and Libraries, heap profiling facilities, and the tools hmake,
greencard, and hp2graph.  Relatively recent additions to the system
are the tracing transformation, trace browsing tools (hat tools),
time profiler, and common FFI.
