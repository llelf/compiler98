<hr>

<p>
The latest stable release is 1.10.  The CVS development tree is now
at version 1.11.  Bugfixes and important changes to the system are
described here for the two most recent released versions.

<p>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.11 (CVS development version) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix:	The Time library now has implementations of addToClockTime
		and diffClockTimes, and tdPicoSec is renamed to tdPicosec.
<li> Bugfix:	The Numeric library now has implementations of floatToDigits,
		formatRealFloat, fromRat, and show[EFG]Float.
<li> Bugfix:	It is now possible to tunnel from hat-trail to
		hat-observe and hat-detect.  In hat-trail, double
		right-click on an identifier to start hat-observe,
		or on an entire redex to start hat-detect.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous small problems with building on MacOS X have
		been ironed out.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.10 (2001-10-19) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix:	The qualified import/export namespace is now managed much
		better by the compiler, in accordance with latest revision
		of the Haskell'98 Report.
<li> Bugfix:	In the Hat tools, there is a more accurate distinction between
		top-level identifiers and local identifiers.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous small bugfixes in hat-observe and hat-detect,
		including better pretty-printing of infix expressions and
		strings.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.08 (2001-09-25) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Tunnels from hat-observe to hat-detect and hat-trail,
		enabling the user to jump directly to something of interest.
<li> New:	Prototype version of the portable source-to-source
		transformation is in progress.
<li> New:	More updates of the the Prelude/Libraries to match the
		recent revisions of the Haskell'98 Report.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous small bugfixes in hat-observe, hat-detect, and
		hat-trail.
<li> Bugfix:	You can now have multiple copies of hat-trail running
		simultaneously.
<li> Bugfix:	A module with an explicit null export list previously
		exported everything - now it correctly exports nothing.
<li> Bugfix:	In multiple equations with identical (n+k) patterns, only
		the first equation was ever matched, the rest were
		previously ignored.
<li> Bugfix:	A negative literal integer in a pattern caused a compiler
		error if the (-) function was not also used in an expression.
<li> Bugfix:	An imported named field, used both as a pattern and a
		selector in the same equation, gave rise to an
		"Unbound Identifier" error.
<li> Bugfix:	Fixes random crashes in primitive implementation of putStr.
<li> Bugfix:	Link options for ncurses (in src/tracer/hat) were in the
		wrong order.
</ul>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic, stable, components include the compiler itself, the Standard
Prelude and Libraries, heap profiling facilities, and the tools hmake,
greencard, and hp2graph.  Relatively recent additions to the system
are the tracing transformation, trace browsing tools (hat tools),
time profiler, and common FFI.
