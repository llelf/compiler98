<b>Known to compile for at least: </b> ix86-Linux, ix86-NetBSD, sparc-solaris2,
mips-IRIX5, mips-Ultrix-4.5, sparc-SunOS4, ix86-CYGWIN-NT4.
<p>
<b>Important note:</b> Before pre-release 10, there were separate packages
for Haskell sources and C sources - these have now been combined.
Binary distribution packages normally follow a full release.


<p>
All the documents available on the web are included in all the packages.
(* Please note that the installation instructions for out-of-date packages
often differ slightly from the ones on the web.  Always follow the
instructions from the package itself.)

<p>
The unified source tree contains the complete Haskell sources for the
compiler, runtime system, standard prelude, and libraries (including
Binary) for <b>nhc98</b>, and current versions of <em>GreenCard</em>,
<em>hp2graph</em>, <em>hmake</em>, and the trace browser.  In addition,
it contains bootstrapping C sources in case you don't already have a
Haskell compiler to build nhc98 with.

<p>
The binary packages contain just the executables, interface files, and
object files for the compiler, runtime system, standard prelude,
libraries (including Binary), <em>GreenCard</em>, <em>hp2graph</em>,
<em>hmake</em> and the trace browser.  In short, everything (except the
sources) needed for normal compilation, heap profiling, time profiling,
and tracing - the full works.

<p>
The <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a> should be
comprehensive, but if you have any problems, please mail

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 15 (2000-01-18) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: There were some minor build-problems with pre14 which I
             hope are now fixed.
<li> Bugfix: Duplicate labels error when building the mutator
             for profiling.
<li> Bugfix: Erroneous compiler complaints about class contexts when
             building certain Prelude functions.
<li> Bugfix: Missing file FFIBuiltin.hi.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 14 (1999-12-02) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Update: Various tweaks and additions to the new FFI to make it more
             solid.  Libraries now include Sven Panne's FFI.
<li> Performance: Thanks to Julian Seward's prompting, we have improved
             the runtime performance of nhc98-compiled programs by about
             25% (if you have gcc).  This also means that if you bootstrap
             nhc98 from C sources, you will get a faster compiler.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 13 (1999-11-19) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Addition: Completely new FFI added, following the Hugs/ghc model.
               Beware, this is still alpha - It might even break unrelated
               things that worked previously!  If in doubt, use 1.0pre12.
<li> Bugfixes: Numerous small fixes for building on various machines.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 12 (1999-10-29) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Removed incorrect .h symbolic links.  (This patch hardly
             seems worth a whole new pre-release, but the bug prevented
             all builds from proceeding.)
<li> Bugfix: On HP-UX machines, the ansiC backend had a problem due to
             conflicts between data/code at link time.

</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 11 (1999-10-26) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Minor fixes to config and Makefiles for <em>Cygwin</em>.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 10 (1999-10-19) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Update: Compiling programs for tracing now works again, although
             tracing versions of the Prelude and Libraries are still
             not fully up-to-date with Haskell'98.  The trace browser
             now has a scripting facility to record your tracing activity
             for later replay.
<li> Update: The removal of named field punning in Haskell'98 has
             turned out to be unpopular.  nhc98 now supports punning
             again as a compile-time option (default on, except in
             -98 compatibility mode).
<li> Update: The old 'nhc98config' is now simplified and called 'configure'.
             This means that "./configure; make; make install" should now
             work as expected.
<li> Update: At configuration time for hmake, we now try to detect existing
             installations of ghc/hbc/nhc and provide sensible defaults,
             so you should no longer need to edit config files.
<li> Bugfix: Resolved conflicts when using hmake flags -I and -d together.
<li> Bugfix: Some changes to Makefiles, so building on <em>Cygwin32</em>
             is easier.
<li> Bugfix: hSetPosn had wrong arity.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 9 (1999-09-16) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Library module Maybe was missing the definition isNothing.
<li> Bugfix: Several changes to Makefiles, so building with <em>ghc</em>
             is easier.
<li> Bugfix: hmake is more <em>ghc</em>-friendly.
<li> Update: The standard cpp symbols __HASKELL98__ and __HASKELL__=98 are
             now supported.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 8 (1999-08-06) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Initialisation of a value using named fields failed to type-check
             if some fields were missing.
<li> Bugfix: Several small script changes required when compiling with <em>ghc</em>.
<li> Bugfix: Compiler fault in processing interface-files - prevented
             profiling and tracing versions of the prelude/libraries from
             building unless the old interface files were removed first.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 7 (1999-07-23) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Brought layout processing into line with the algorithm
             given in the Report.
<li> Update: Underscores are now (optionally) treated in full accordance
             with the Report as strictly lower-case.
<li> Update: Licensing conditions for nhc98 are now more explicit.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 6 (1999-06-10) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Update: At last, we grudgingly support <tt>(n+k)</tt> patterns.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 5 (990519) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Change: Simpler configuration for hmake and nhc98.
<li> Update: Infix decls now allowed anywhere type signatures are.  Modules
             can be imported unqualified with a local alias.  Aliases can
             overlap.  Empty decls (i.e. extra explicit semicolons) are allowed. 
<li> Bugfix: isAlphanum is now isAlphaNum.
<li> Bugfix: Derived Read instances for non-associative infix constructors
             now work (previously looped).
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 4 (990503) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fixes: compiler's source code needs to compile under Haskell 98 also!
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 3 (990427) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fixes: compiler has better compliance with Haskell 98.  (Maximal
     munch for comments, removed record punning, and numerous other changes.)
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 2 (990217) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix: Stable Pointers, as used in GreenCard, are now non-strict,
             i.e. passing the value (error "message") to C as a stable
             pointer no longer terminates the program immediately.
</ul>

<h3>nhc98 pre-release 1 (990128) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Major change: nhc13 has become nhc98, supporting the new Haskell 98
                   language standard, although still incompletely.
<li> Major addition: Existential types in data declarations.
<li> Addition: New options <tt>-M</tt> and <tt>-Md</tt> to <em>hmake</em>.
<li> Bugfix: In the Binary library there was a very slight incompatibility
             between the types described in the ISMM'98 paper and the
             implementation.  The implementation is now fixed to match the
             paper.
<li> Bugfix: At last, the distribution tarfiles extract into an
             nhc98-x.x directory, rather than the current directory.
</ul>
