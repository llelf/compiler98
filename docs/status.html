<center><h1>nhc98 status</h1></center>

<hr>

<p>
The latest stable release is 1.14.  The CVS development tree is now
at version 1.15.  Bugfixes and important changes to the system are
described here for the two most recent released versions.

<p>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.14a (2002-08-13) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> The only change between 1.14 and 1.14a is that the version of
     hmake included in the source package has been updated from 3.05
     to 3.06.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.14 (2002-06-14) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	The Hat tracing system is now entirely separate from
		the nhc98 compiler.  Hat can now be used with either ghc
		or nhc98 - you should download and build the Hat system
		<em>after</em> building nhc98.
<li> New:	The compiler now supports a simplified version of ghc's
		package mechanism.  No documentation yet, but Hat relies
		on it.
<li> Performance: Various patches for improved time/space usage of the
		compiler itself, contributed by Thomas Nordin.
<li> Bugfix:	Various small fixes for OS environments like OpenBSD,
		ix86-Solaris, etc.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.12 (2002-03-14) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	The old hat-trail tool written in Java is now obsolete,
		replaced by a brand new version written in Haskell.
<li> New:	There are numerous improvements to the Hat tools, and
		their command syntax is now simplified and much more
		uniform.
<li> New:	All possible tunnels between hat-trail, hat-observe, and
		hat-detect are now available.
<li> New:	The first version of the portable Hat transformation is
		now available.  In other words, Hat can now compile simple
		programs with ghc instead of nhc98.
<li> Bugfix:	The Time library now has implementations of addToClockTime
		and diffClockTimes, and tdPicoSec is renamed to tdPicosec.
<li> Bugfix:	The Numeric library now has implementations of floatToDigits,
		formatRealFloat, fromRat, and show[EFG]Float.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous small problems with building on MacOS X have
		been ironed out.
<li> Bugfix:	The IO library did not re-export the PreludeIO definitions.
<li> Bugfix:	An infix pattern decl of the form
		a `Foo` (b `Bar` c) = 3 `Foo` (4 `Bar` 5)
		could not be compiled because the parser lost the explicit
		bracketing on the LHS.
<li> Bugfix:	Allow an empty import/export decl with a single stray comma.
<li> Bugfix:	Fix block-buffered file handles, so that they produce output
		exactly when the buffer is full.
<li> Bugfix:	Do not treat `qualified', `hiding', or `interface' as keywords
		of the language - they are significant only in certain
		positions.
<li> Bugfix:	Increase garbage collection counters to 64-bits for correct
		reports in long-running computations.
<li> Bugfix:	Accept `instance ClassName (Prelude.-&gt;)' in source and
		interface files.
<li> Bugfix:	Work around a rare buffer problem in hp2graph.
<li> Bugfix:	Where an entire module is re-exported, but one of its
		variables is hidden on import, the hidden variable should
		not be re-exported.
<li> Bugfix:	Fix link message "undefined reference to
		`FN_Ix_46_95_46Unknown_46variable'" when using library Array.
<li> Bugfix:	Update configuration script (again) to detect ghc-5.02
		correctly.
</ul>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic, stable, components include the compiler itself, the Standard
Prelude and Libraries, heap profiling facilities, and the tools hmake,
greencard, and hp2graph.  Relatively recent additions to the system
are the time profiler and common FFI.
