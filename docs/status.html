<hr>

<p>
The latest stable release is 1.06.  The CVS development tree is at
version 1.07.  Bugfixes and important changes to the system are
described here for the two most recent released versions.

<p>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.06 (2001-06-08) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Updated the Prelude/Libraries to match the newly revised
		Haskell'98 Report.
<li> Update:	Default build target is now basic + tracer (was just basic).
<li> Update:	Building with gcc now builds everything with gcc, including
		profiling and tracing.  This is much faster.
<li> Bugfix:	A bad interaction between Java and Cygwin to do with Unix
		vs. Windows pathnames.  (Visible only in Hat-trail and Hood.)
<li> Bugfix:	An 'hi' built with just a C compiler seg-faulted, due to
                mismatched .c file versions in the 1.04 source package.
<li> Bugfix:	Recognise an existing ghc-5 installation.
<li> Bugfix:	Missing include <errno.h> for Cygwin.
<li> Bugfix:	Minor filename recognition error in hat-stack and hat-connect.
<li> Bugfix:	Filename extension for time profiling changed to .z.o to
		avoid Windows conflicts between .T.o and .t.o.  The compiler
		flags -T and -t are unchanged, -z is a new synonym for -t.
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.04 (2001-05-21) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Support for extended module namespaces of the form
		Long.Hierarchical.Module.Name is now provided in both
		nhc98 and hmake.
<li> Update:	Improved printing of I/O error messages.
<li> Update:	Improved (more accurate) time profiling now provided.
<li> Bugfix:	An identifier hidden on import and redefined in the
		current module, then exported, but also imported
		qualified and used qualified in the current module,
		led to an incorrect interface file being generated.
<li> Bugfix:	hmake issued an unnecessary -cpp flag on some literate files.
<li> Bugfix:	Type of IO.hSetPosn :: Handle -> HandlePosn -> IO ()
		was incorrect
<li> Bugfix:	Compile-time error in <tt>src/tracer/runtime/ident.c</tt>
		on RedHat 7 and other systems using the new ISO C standard
		for <tt>fpos_t</tt>.
<li> Bugfix:	A file opened in ReadMode or WriteMode was actually
		opened in ReadWriteMode, so if the file had strict
		permissions the correct opening command would fail.
		Conversely, opening in ReadWriteMode actually gave
		ReadMode instead, and file updates silently failed.
<li> Bugfix:	Operator sections suffered from priority inversion,
		for example (^2*3) was incorrectly parsed as (^(2*3)),
		even though ^ binds more tightly than *.
<li> Bugfix:	The library function Directory.createDirectory gave
		strange permissions to the new directory.  (Mode was
		in hex, but should have been octal!)

</ul>
The following updates and bugfixes are specifically for <em>Hat</em>,
the redex-trail-based tracing and debugging system.
<ul>
<li> New architecture:  Traced programs now build their trails in files,
		not in the heap.  This has four consequences:  (1)
		you no longer need to give your program large amounts
		of extra memory to trace it;  but (2) you may need to have
		large amounts of free disk space, particularly to trace
		long-running programs; (3) for the moment, traced
		programs now run even slower (we are working to improve
		this); and (4) trails are now first-class objects,
		so new tools can manipulate them to provide several
		different views of the computation.
<li> New tools:	Storing trails in files means we can now provide more
		tools to examine them.  The original graphical browser is
		now renamed <b>hat-trail</b>, and can fully explore the
		redex trails in file.
		<b>hat-stack</b> gives a virtual stack back-trace
		from a trail file (no need to re-run the program).
		<b>hat-observe</b> gives you HOOD-like
		observation of the input and output from functions.
		<b>hat-detect</b> does algorithmic debugging in the style
		of Freja; it discovers and identifies the location of
		a bug after asking you some simple questions.
		<b>hat-check</b> verifies the integrity of the trail
		file, prints a textual dump, and gives statistics about
		its contents.
<li> Update:	Fuller Standard Library support for tracing: added
		Directory, System, CPUTime, Random.
		(Still missing: Time, Locale.)
<li> Update:	More Haskell'98 language features are accepted:
		named fields can now be traced, although the hat
		tools don't yet show them in source form.  Pattern
		bindings are also handled better.
</ul>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic, stable, components include the compiler itself, the Standard
Prelude and Libraries, heap profiling facilities, and the tools hmake,
greencard, and hp2graph.  Relatively recent additions to the system
are the tracing transformation, trace browsing tools (hat tools),
time profiler, and common FFI.
