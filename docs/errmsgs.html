<h3>What does this error message mean?</h3>

<p>
Like all compilers, the error messages produced by the <b>nhc98</b> are
sometimes difficult to understand.  Here are a few tips as to what might
have gone wrong.

<dl>
<dt><pre>
Only 32 words after gc, need 32 words
</pre></dt>
<dd>
The garbage collector failed to reclaim enough space - the program is
out of heap.  Try re-running with <em>+RTS -Hn -RTS</em> where
<em>n</em> is a bigger heap size, e.g. <em>16M</em>.
</dd>

<dt><pre>
Type error: cannot unify types Prelude.2 and Prelude.3 at 133:9
</pre></dt>
<dd>
In type errors, pairs, triples, and other tuples are denoted by their
arity - thus Prelude.2 means pair.  The notation 133:9 means line 133,
character position 9.
</dd>

<dt><pre>
arityIS in IntState.hs couldn't find 376
</pre></dt>
<dd>
If you get an error message like this and you have an <em>(n+k)</em>
pattern in your program, then you have found a bug in the compiler.
Please report it!
