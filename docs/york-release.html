<h3>Why use the <em>nhc98</em> Haskell compiler?</h3>

<dl>
<dt><em>Because it is easy to install.</em></dt>
<dd> Some people find <em>ghc</em> and <em>hbc</em> difficult to install
  on their machine.  <em>nhc98</em> is about as easy to setup
  as Hugs, and it is as portable too.</dd>

<dt><em>Because you have a small machine.</em></dt>
<dd>  <em>nhc98</em> is designed for space-efficiency.  Compile the same
  program under either <em>ghc</em> or <em>hbc</em>, and compare it with
  that produced by <em>nhc98</em>.  Generally, <em>nhc98</em> produces
  much smaller executables, and runtime space usage is also
  <em>very</em> much smaller.  (With the <em>nhc98</em> Binary library
  you can compress your heap data in addition to the normal savings.)
  Expect to pay a speed penalty though - programs produced by
  <em>nhc98</em> run slower than with <em>ghc</em> or <em>hbc</em>
  (although they are still rather faster than <em>Hugs</em>).</dd>

<dt><em>Because you're a software developer.</em></dt>
<dd>  Fed up waiting for <em>ghc</em> to compile your programs?
  <em>nhc98</em> can be pretty quick at compiling, even though it
  is not as fast as <em>hbc</em>.  For development work, it can also
  provide a useful check that you are sticking to the Haskell 98
  standard and avoiding compiler-specific extensions.</dd>

<dt><em>Because your programs have strange space behaviour.</em></dt>
<dd>
  <em>nhc98</em> has the most advanced heap profiler in the Haskell
  world, allowing you to observe in very fine detail exactly what is
  happening to the heap.  Profile types include producer, construction,
  retainer, biography, and lifetime - and any combination thereof.</dd>

<dt><em>Because your program crashes, or produces the wrong output.</em></dt>
<dd>
  <em>nhc98</em> has advanced tracing facilities,
  based on a reduction trail browser.  Browsing proceeds
  <em>backwards</em> from the error message or suspicious output value,
  observing and exploring the reduction history of parts of the
  computation.  By answering the question "What function application caused
  the evaluation of this expression?" at each stage, it is possible to
  narrow down program bugs quickly.  (The tracer is still part
  of ongoing research, and will continue to be developed for some
  time.)</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Novel features of <em>nhc98</em></h3>
<p>
Features of <em>nhc98</em> which are not necessarily available in all
other Haskell systems include: binary data representations; the
<em>GreenCard</em> foreign language interface; the new common primitive
FFI; computational traces; time profiling; and portable compilation via
C.

<ul>
<li>
  <em>nhc98</em> can generate code for <em>tracing (debugging) your
  computations</em>.  A tutorial describing how to use the tracer is
  <a href="tracer.html">now available</a>.  See also references [2] and
  [3].  This prototype tracer will continue to be developed further.

<li>
  <em>Binary data representations.</em> In summary, an additional library
  module provides bit-stream operations and a new Binary class for which
  the compiler fully supports "deriving" clauses.
  Fuller details can be found in [1] and in
  <a href="libs/Binary.html">this documentation</a>.

<li>
  <em>GreenCard</em> is a preprocessor for interfacing to C libraries.  It was
  developed for ghc and hugs, and is now available for <em>nhc98</em>.  See
  <a href="greencard-york.html">this page</a> for details.  The newer common
  <a href="ffi.html">primitive FFI</a> is also now available.

<li>
  Advanced facilities for heap-profiling programs.  See tutorial paper [4].

<li>
  Basic facilities for time-profiling programs.

<li>
  Existential types.

<li>
  Finally, with a little extra work, <em>nhc98</em> can be used as a
  cross-compiler for other machines, including embedded systems.  It can
  generate bytecode in a portable ANSI-C format.

</ul>


<h3>Why are there York and Chalmers releases?</h3>
<p>
The Chalmers release of <em>nhc13</em> froze in October 1996.
Although Niklas is continuing to refine <em>nhc</em> at Chalmers, (playing
with new language features, fixing bugs and so on), his time available
for working on <em>nhc</em> is limited, so he prefers to spend it on
exciting new development rather than on the tedious business of
producing distribution packages.
<p>
At York, we are engaged in programming languages research which
has resulted in additional development of <em>nhc98</em>, mainly
focussed on adding new compiler features, libraries, and tools.
We incorporate Niklas's latest work, and will continue to do so.
Currently, the York release is the only distribution of <em>nhc98</em>.
<p>
There is another version of <em>nhc13</em> (modified to compile a research
dialect of Haskell) available elsewhere (location currently unknown).
