<hr>

<h3>Bugs by design :-)</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>the monomorphism restriction</em></dt>
  <dd>is not implemented.</dd>
<dt><em>the Unicode character set</em></dt>
  <dd>is not supported yet - characters are still 8-bit.</dd>
<dt><em>Latin-ISO-8859-1 character set not fully supported</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test18.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Overloaded cafs are treated as functions (debatable "problem")</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test4.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Unintended bugs :-(</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Strictness annotations on named-field labels</em></dt>
  <dd>are not implemented - although you can use strictness annotations
      elsewhere.</dd>
<dt><em>Read/Show instances for named-fields</em></dt>
  <dd>do not show or read the label syntax, just the values.</dd>
<dt><em>Precursor to one below </em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test2.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Type checking: default declarations</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test3.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Bizarre error on seq interacting with classes</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test5.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Using an imported renaming type to define a second renaming type</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/Nhc13Test13.hs">Example module</a>.
      <a href="bugs/nhc13test13.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Importing qualified Prelude and then using an unqualified Prelude entity</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test16.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>Contexts required in let-bindings</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test17.hs">Example program</a>.  This is
      a consequence of the non-implementation of the monomorphism
      restriction.</dd>
<dt><em>GreenCard IO cafs</em></dt>
  <dd>A CAF (constant applicative form) of type <tt>IO a</tt> implemented
      as a C-function via GreenCard is only evaluated once.</dd>
<dt><em>Compiler crashes on large source files</em></dt>
  <dd>Very rarely, the compiler will crash on a large source file
      with a ``pointer stack overflow'' or a ``heap overrun'', or sometimes
      no message at all.  As far as I can tell, this is a space fault in
      the ansi-C backend.  A workaround is to use the <em>-noansiC</em>
      flag (provided you are using a machine for which we have direct
      assembly language support, i.e. arm, hppa, sparc, x86, mips, alpha).</dd>
<dt><em>ghc-4.06 bug</em></dt>
  <dd>If you build nhc98 using ghc-4.06, all code using Floats and Doubles
      is broken.  This is due to a bug in ghc, due to be fixed in 4.07.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Fixed bugs :-)</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Runtime crashes on Array-based programs</em> (fixed 000314)</dt>
  <dd>A program although it compiled, crashed intermittently at runtime,
      sometimes with SegFaults, sometimes with other errors.  This was
      caused by an obscure Garbage Collection bug, because changing the
      heap size altered the behaviour.  Although we originally believed
      that the Regexp library from Glasgow was the only known program to
      tickle this bug, it turned out that other programs using Arrays
      also suffered the same fate.  The fix turned out to be a single
      character change in the sources!</dd>
<dt><em>Named fields</em> (fixed 990727)</dt>
  <dd>Initialisation of a value using named fields failed to type-check
      (error: typeExp) if some fields were missing.</dd>
<dt><em>(n+k) patterns</em></dt>
  <dd>are finally supported by nhc98.</dd>
<dt><em>Stable pointers in GreenCard</em> (fixed 990217)</dt>
  <dd>used to be too strict - for instance passing the closure
      <tt>error "message"</tt> into C-world as a stable pointer would
      terminate a program immediately.  They are now properly lazy -
      a stable pointer to the closure <tt>error "message"</tt> now
      terminates the program only if and when it is hauled back into
      Haskell world and evaluated.</dd>
<dt><em>Re-defining Prelude entities should strictly speaking cause an error</em></dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test15.hs">Example program</a>.  Although this
      was a bug in <b>nhc13</b>, Haskell 98 fixed it for us, by allowing
      redefinition of imported entities.</dd>
<dt><em>GreenCard parser</em> (fixed 981103)</dt>
  <dd>did not notify syntax errors - it simply generated bogus
      Haskell and C.  (This was because the original GreenCard parser was
      generated by Happy, which can only be used in conjunction with ghc.
      For nhc13, we had been using a cheap and cheerful
      parser combinator library without error-detection.  We have now
      added error-detection to the combinators.)</dd>
<dt><em>Unknown instruction 199</em> (fixed 980827)</dt>
  <dd>A GreenCard-ed program which called C which called back to Haskell
      which called out to C again would sometimes fail with this error.
      The system simply forgot to stack the outward call contexts and
      so returned to the wrong place.</dd>
<dt><em>Prelude.product</em> (fixed 980702)</dt>
  <dd>Incorrectly defined as <tt>foldl (*) 0</tt>, rather than
      <tt>foldl (*) 1</tt>.</dd>
<dt><em>Garbage collecting BinHandles</em> (fixed 980702)</dt>
  <dd>When the GC collected a Memory BinHandle, it first tried to close
      it, which occasionally called the GC again recursively, generating
      a segmentation fault.</dd>
<dt><em>multiple-precision integers</em> (fixed 980407)</dt>
  <dd>The functions (>) and (>=) were semantically swapped for
      multiple-precision integers (type <tt>Integer</tt>).</dd>
<dt><em>GreenCard</em> (fixed 980323)</dt>
  <dd>A C function of type <tt>() -> IO a</tt> was only ever called once
      (and the result shared with all other calls), because the unit argument
      was stripped, leaving a zero-arity CAF.  This is now fixed so that
      the unit argument is passed through, forcing re-evaluation with every
      call.</dd>
<dt><em>Binary library</em> (fixed 980302)</dt>
  <dd><tt>closeBin</tt> operation sometimes caused unexpected effects -
      both <tt>closeBin</tt> and the garbage collector free'd the same
      malloc'd memory</dd>
<dt><em>Pattern matching with no fields against constructions with no fields</em>
(fixed 980203)</dt>
  <dd><a href="bugs/nhc13test20.hs">Example program</a>.</dd>
<dt><em>sparc space faults</em> (fixed 971120)</dt>
  <dd>Occasionally GreenCard crashed horribly on the sparc architecture with
      a segmentation fault, which went away if you
      increased the heapsize.  Also, programs compiled with -p on the sparc
      crashed when you attempted to gather a runtime profile.
      (UserGC structure allocated wrong amount of space.)
