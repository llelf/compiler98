We are pleased to announce a new release of the nhc98 compiler and the
hmake compilation manager.  nhc98 is portable to almost any 32-bit
unix-like platform, and can be easily bootstrapped with just a C
compiler if no existing Haskell compiler is available.  Hmake plays
happily with ghc and hbc as well as nhc98.

This release is mainly a maintenance refresh, fixing numerous bugs,
and adding support for many of the new hierarchical libraries that
are also supplied with ghc-6.4 and Hugs.

Main feature updates:
    * Supplied with these standard library packages:
          base, parsec, haskell-src, QuickCheck, HaXml, HUnit, Cabal
    * FFI: foreign import "dynamic" is now supported, and C
           header-files named in an import are now respected.
    * cpphs: The compiler and hmake now use cpphs rather than your
             C compiler for preprocessing.  This removes problems with
             string gaps, primes in identifiers, and so on.
    * Now supplied with a small test suite to help verify whether
      the compiler works on new platforms.

Main bugfixes:
    * Resolved configuration bugs when using ghc-6.2 and ghc-6.4 with hmake.
    * Build failures associated with gcc-3.3 and upward have been fixed.

This release of nhc98 has been tested on the following machines:
    ix86-Linux      (Slackware 10 and RedHat 7.2 using ghc, hbc, gcc, nhc98)
    ix86-Cygwin     (Windows 2000 using gcc (fails with ghc))
    sparc-solaris2  (SunOS 5.9 using ghc, gcc, nhc98)
    powerpc-Darwin7 (MacOS X 10.3 using ghc, gcc)
